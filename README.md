  ## About

Malkiel Investment is an Investment group within the BnR Beurs Investment Society in Rotterdam. Inspired by leading economists such as Malkiel or Taleb this investment team tries to encompass the statistical significance of ‘blindfolded monkeys beating the market’. The fundamental idea is that by determining a pool of securities in advance, and randomizing selection from this pool, a market outperforming exposure is reached. 

This repo is used to display the code necessary for the randomisation used in Malkiel_Investments investment strategy.
